# portfolio_site
 
This is a work-in-progress docker-compose of my portfolio site made with flask and nginx.
I used wsl2 to get docker to work for development in vs code.
I also used ngrok so I could access it outside the network although I will be looking for a long term hosting solution.
I look forward to adding more content to the website itself in the future.
